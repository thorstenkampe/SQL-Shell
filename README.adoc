== Introduction
Modern SQL shells like `mssql-cli`, `mycli`, `SQLcl` or `pgcli` are very convenient: they offer auto-completion, syntax highlighting, query history, a multi-line editor, and much more.

`SQL Shell` makes using your favorite SQL client even more convenient:

* a standard interface to enter connection parameters so you don't have to remember command line options and syntax
* defaults for host name, port, and user to save you time

Additional features:

* DSNs (pre-defined connection strings) for connections without typing
* automatic tunneling if your database is not accessible from the outside (behind a firewall or listening only on localhost interface)
* legacy client support

== Requirements
* Linux
** Python3
** Python modules `click` and `sshtunnel`
* SQL shells
** https://github.com/dbcli/mssql-cli[mssql-cli], https://www.mycli.net[mycli], https://www.oracle.com/database/technologies/appdev/sqlcl.html[SQLcl], https://www.pgcli.com[pgcli], https://sqlite.org/cli.html[sqlite3]
