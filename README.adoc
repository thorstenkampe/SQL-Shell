== Introduction
Modern SQL shells like `mssql-cli`, `mycli`, `SQLcl` or `pgcli` are very convenient: they offer auto-completion, syntax highlighting, query history, a multi-line editor, and much more.

`SQL Shell` makes using your favorite SQL client even more convenient: it brings a standard interface to enter the necessary information to access your database so you don't have to remember command line options and syntax. Timesaving defaults are used for host name, port, and user.

Additional features:

* legacy clients (`sqlcmd`, `mysql`, `SQLPlus`, `psql`, `sqlite3`) as fallback
* use DSNs (pre-defined connection strings) for connections without typing
* automatic tunneling if your database is not accessible from the outside (behind a firewall or listening only on localhost interface)

== Requirements
* Python3
* Python modules
** `click`
** `sshtunnel`
** `windows-curses` (on Windows)
* SQL shells
** MSSQL: https://github.com/dbcli/mssql-cli[mssql-cli] (or legacy https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/tools/sqlcmd-utility[sqlcmd])
** MySQL: https://www.mycli.net[mycli] (or legacy https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/mysql.html[mysql])
** Oracle: https://www.oracle.com/database/technologies/appdev/sqlcl.html[SQLcl] (or legacy https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/oracle-database/21/sqpug/toc.htm[SQLPlus])
** PostgreSQL: https://www.pgcli.com[pgcli] (or legacy https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/app-psql.html[psql])
** SQLite: https://litecli.com[litecli] (or legacy https://sqlite.org/cli.html[sqlite3])

== Installation
* install Python3, required third-party Python modules, and SQL shell clients of your choice.
** Windows: copy `sql shell.exe`, `sql shell.ini`, and `tunnel.ini` to a directory of your choice.
** Linux: copy `sql shell.py`, `tunnel.py`, `sql shell.ini`, and `tunnel.ini` to a directory of your choice.
