== Introduction
Modern SQL shells like `mssql-cli`, `mycli`, `SQLcl` and `pgcli` are very convenient: they offer auto-completion, syntax highlighting, query history, a multi-line editor, and much more.

`SQL Shell` makes using SQL clients even more convenient:

* a standard interface to enter connection parameters so you don't have to remember command line options
* pre-defined connection strings for connection without typing
* automatic tunneling if your database is behind a firewall or listening only on localhost interface

== Requirements ==
* SQL shell clients (https://github.com/dbcli/mssql-cli[`mssql-cli`], https://www.mycli.net[`mycli`], https://www.oracle.com/database/technologies/appdev/sqlcl.html[`SQLcl`], https://www.pgcli.com[`pgcli`], https://litecli.com[`litecli`]) or legacy clients (`sqlcmd`, `mysql`, `SQLPlus`, `psql`, `sqlite3`)
* Linux only: Python modules `click`, `npyscreen`, `pycompat`, and `sshtunnel`

== Installation
. download release
. verify requirements

== Usage
. optional: edit `sql shell.ini` and `tunnel.ini` to match your environment
. run `sql shell.exe` (Windows) or `sql shell.py` (Linux)
