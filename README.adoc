== Introduction
Modern SQL shells like `mssql-cli`, `mycli`, `SQLcl` and `pgcli` are very convenient: they offer auto-completion, syntax highlighting, query history, a multi-line editor, and much more.

`SQL Shell` makes using your favorite SQL client even more convenient:

* a standard interface to enter connection parameters so you don't have to remember command line options
* defaults for host name, port, and user to save you time
* DSNs (pre-defined connection strings) for connection without typing
* automatic tunneling if your database is behind a firewall or listening only on localhost interface
* legacy client support

== Requirements
* Windows: none
* Linux: Python3, modules `click`, `npyscreen`, and `sshtunnel`
* SQL shells:
** https://github.com/dbcli/mssql-cli[`mssql-cli`], https://www.mycli.net[`mycli`], https://www.oracle.com/database/technologies/appdev/sqlcl.html[`SQLcl`], https://www.pgcli.com[`pgcli`], https://litecli.com[`litecli`]
** (or legacy https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/tools/sqlcmd-utility[`sqlcmd`], `mysql`, `SQLPlus`, `psql`, https://sqlite.org/cli.html[`sqlite3`])

== Installation
* Windows
** copy `sql shell.exe`, `sql shell.ini`, and `tunnel.ini` to a directory of your choice
* Linux
** install required third-party Python modules
** copy `sql shell.py`, `tunnel.py`, `sql shell.ini`, and `tunnel.ini` to a directory of your choice
* install SQL shell clients of your choice
* modify `sql shell.ini` and optionally `tunnel.ini` to match your environment
