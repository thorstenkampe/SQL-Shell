Modern SQL shells are very convenient: they offer auto-completion, syntax highlighting, query history, a multi-line editor, and much more.

SQL Shell makes using your favorite SQL client even more convenient:

* a standard interface to enter connection parameters so you don't have to remember command line options
* defaults for host name, port, and user to save you time
* DSNs (pre-defined connection strings) for connection without typing
* automatic tunneling if your database is behind a firewall or listening only on localhost interface
* legacy client support (sqlcmd, mysql, SQLPlus, psql, sqlite3)
