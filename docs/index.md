Modern SQL shells like SQLcl, mycli, pgcli, and mssql-cli are very convenient: they offer auto-completion, syntax highlighting, query history, a multi-line editor, and much more.

SQL Shell makes using SQL clients even more convenient:

* a standard interface to enter connection parameters so you don't have to remember command line options
* defaults for host name, and port to save you time
* pre-defined connection strings for connection without typing
* automatic tunneling if your database is behind a firewall or listening only on localhost interface
* legacy client support
